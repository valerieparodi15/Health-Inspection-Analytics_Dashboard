**Steps:**
- Loaded raw violation and inspection records
- Handled missing/inconsistent data
- Standardized business names
- Parsed Columns
- Output: Clean datasets (`data/cleaned/violations_cleaned.csv`)

### 2. Pre-Analysis & Aggregation (SQL)
SQL queries were used for data exploration and creating aggregated tables for Power BI.

**See [`sql/`](sql/) directory for all queries**

**Key Queries:**
- `sql/data_exploration.sql` - Initial data profiling and quality checks
- `sql/violations_by_year_city.sql` - Aggregations by year and city
- `sql/violations_by_business.sql` - Business-level violation summaries
- `sql/risk_level_analysis.sql` - Risk categorization analysis
- `sql/final_dataset.sql` - Final denormalized dataset for Power BI
